* Built using MVVM-C pattern (Model View ViewModel - Coordinator), combined with a reactive approach using Combine framework. ⇝ No fat VC issue, each of the view controllers in this project have less than 80 loc :tm: + they are isolated & have no knowledge of each other, thanks to the Coordinator pattern.
