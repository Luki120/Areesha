* Built using MVVM-C pattern (Model View ViewModel - Coordinator), combined with a reactive approach using Combine framework. ‚áù No fat VC issue, each of the view controllers in this project have less than 70 loc :tm: + they are isolated & have no knowledge of each other, thanks to the Coordinator pattern.

* [ ] Build settings UI.
* [x] Build seasons UI.
* [x] Build season's episodes UI.
* [ ] Build episode details UI.
* [x] Get rid of class prefixes üíÄ.
* [ ] Persist chosen TV shows logic.
* [x] Slide the search text field from top once `ARTVShowSearchVC` appears.
